            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>I thynke nat / for as I take it: the doyng of the waſt of ſuche particuler tenantes for terme of lyfe / for terme of yeres / or of tenantes in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16833:84"/>
dower / or by the curteſye: is prohibite by the lawe of reaſon / for it ſemeth of reaſon that whan ſuche leaſes be made / or that ſuche tytles in dower or by the curteſy be gyuen by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe that there is onely gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto them the annuall ꝓfites of the lande and nat the houſes &amp; trees &amp; the grauel to dygge &amp; cary away / wherby the hole ꝓfite of them in the reuercion ſhulde be taken away for euer.

                        <p>That is true / but there is great diuerſite bytwene this tenant &amp; a tenant for terme of lyfe: for this tenaunt hath good autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite by the donour to do waſte / &amp; ſo hathe nat the tenaunte for terme of lyfe / as it is ſayd before. For the eſtate of a tenaunt in tayle after poſſibilite of yſſue extyncte is in this maner. Whan landes be gyuen to a man &amp; to his wyfe and to the heyres of theyr two bodyes begotten / and after the one of them dyeth without heyres of their bodyes begotten / than he or ſhe that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyueth / is called tenant in tayle after poſſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bilite of yſſue extyncte / bycauſe there can neuer by no poſſibilite be any heyre that may inheryte by force of that gyfte. And thus it apereth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the donees at the tyme of the gyfte: receyued of the donour eſtate of enheritance / which by poſſibilite might haue continued for euer / wherby they had power to cut downe trees &amp; to do all thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge that is waſt / as tenant i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fee ſimple myght and that authorite was as ſtronge in the lawe as if the leſſour that maketh a leaſe for terme of lyfe ſay by expreſſe wordes in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16833:86"/>
the leaſe that the leſſe ſhall nat be punyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhable of waſte. And therfore if the donour in this caſe had graunted to the donees that they ſhulde nat be puniſſhable of waſt that graunt had ben voyde bycauſe it was included in the gyfte before as it ſhulde be vpon a gyfte in fe ſimple: &amp; ſo for as moch as by the fyrſte gyfte and by the lyuere of ſeaſon made vpon the ſame: the donees had authorite by the donour to do waſte. Therfore though the one of the donees be nowe deed without yſſue / ſo that it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne that after the dethe of the other: the lande ſhall reuerte to the donour / yet the authorite that they had by the donour to do waſte: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinueth as longe as the gyfte and the lyuerey of ſeaſon made vpon the ſame co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinueth: and I take this to be the reaſon why he ſhal nat haue in ayde as te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt for terme of lyfe ſhal / that is to ſay / for that he can nat aſke helpe of that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime / wherby it is ordeyned that a tenant for terme of lyfe ſhall haue in ayde / for he can nat ſay but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he toke a greater eſtate by the lyuerey of ſeaſon that was made to hym: whiche yet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinueth than for terme of lyfe / &amp; ſo I thynke hym nat bounde to make any reſtitucion to hym in the reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion

ſuche a contradicion in the courte whiche in the lawe called an inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / &amp; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe is bycauſe this certificate of the byſſhope is the hyeſt trial that is i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the law i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this behalfe.

reſtitucion / than he that pleadeth the plee: ſhulde renne therby in lyke offence / for he hathe holpen to ſet the other man in ſuche a liberty that he may choſe whether he wil reſtore the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de or nat / and ſo he ſhulde put hym ſelfe to the ieoparty of a nother man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes conſcience.

I ſhall ſhewe the the cauſe why I thynke the rente is extyncte in conſcience as well as in lawe.

lyke wyſe it remayneth to the lawe and cu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtome of the realme to determine howe lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſuche rentes ſhall continue.

entended for to be bounde or naye. And of the entente inwarde in the herte: mannes lawe cane nat iuge / and that is one of the cauſes why the lawe of god is neceſſarye (that is to ſay) to iuge inwarde thynges / and if an accion ſhulde lye in that caſe in the lawe Canon / than ſhulde the lawe Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>non iuge vpon the inwarde intente of the herte / whiche can nat be as me ſemeth.</p>

Vpon this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſe an accion lyeth if he mary his dough<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter / and in this caſe he cane nat diſcharge the promyſe thoughe he thought nat to be bounde therby / for it is a good contracte / and he maye haue Quid pro quo / that is to ſaye / the prefermente of his dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for his money.
